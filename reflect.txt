Final Project Milestone 1
Author	Juan David Avendao
-----------------------------------------------------------
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.
-----------------------------------------------------------
It has been really hard to understand how is stored the data 
in memory. The creation of this application taught me how to 
work in modules, and how to split, organize, manage and program
 large projects. Understanding inheritance also helped me to
 save too many lines of code. This can be reflected in the 
inheritance of the Motorcycle and Car classes that both come 
from the Vehicle class and in turn come from the ReadWritable
 class. I found it very curious how we divide the information 
of the display of the menus and the data.

The way of storing the information in the array has also been 
very interesting how through a function that was created in the 
vehicle class we could access the value inside a data member 
that was protected by privacy as the function getparkingSpot(),
 and in this way locate the objects that were being integrated 
to our application.

Definitely the biggest project I have ever worked on and I am 
excited about what is to come in the following semesters. Thank
 you very much professor for everything, because despite the 
complications that have arisen to overcome each milestone gave 
me a sense of pride that gave recognition to the effort given 
throughout this last year.
